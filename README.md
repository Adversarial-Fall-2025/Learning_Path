# PandaHat-Adversarial-Research
This project explores adversarial attacks on machine learning models, focusing on improving computational efficiency and reducing energy consumption. Conducted as part of our work with CAHSI and MIT Lincoln Labs, the research aims to enhance the resilience of AI models while understanding the mathematical principles behind adversarial attacks.

This research is divided into two groups: "Power_Consumption" and "Learning_Path".
The first group focuses in learning and finding new ways to improve computational efficiency and reducing energy consumption within AI models. The second group focuses in learning the fundamentals and mathematic concepts of AI, specifically Neural Networks.

## Documentation:
We will be using **Markdown** to document our progress directly within Jupyter Notebooks. 
Markdown allows us to create well-organized and readable notes, which helps keep track of our work and makes it easier for others to follow.

 ### Why document our progress?
- Documenting our progress is crucial because it improves clarity, facilitates collaboration, and helps us track changes effectively. 
- By writing down our thought process and decisions, we make it easier for team members to understand the work and contribute more efficiently. 
- Clear documentation also ensures reproducibility, allowing others (or our future selves) to recreate results and build on previous work. It helps identify what worked and what didn’t, making troubleshooting and improvements faster and more effective.
- Ultimately, consistent documentation saves time, reduces confusion, and increases overall efficiency within the team.

    Here is a cheatsheet of Markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ 


## How to get started with Jupyter Notebook?

1. Make sure to have Git install in your computer. 
2. VSCode Extentions you will need: 
    - Python : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
    - Jupyter : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter
    - Jupyter Keymap: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap
    - Jupyter Cell Tags: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-cell-tags 
    
    Other Extensions (Not needed, but good to have):
    - Python Debugger
    ...
3. Clone the Repository into your VSCode (Make sure that you are signed in to your github account in VSCode!)
4. To create your Jupyter Notebook, 
    - Enter the Notebook Folder
    - For the Jupyter Notebook add a new file with this format **"task_INITIALS_Version.ipynb"**.  Example : task1_RMQV_V9.07.ipynb
5. Once the Jupyter Notebook file is created, configure the Kernel:
    - In the upper right corner Select Kernel, then Python, then Virtual Environment (.venv (Python)).

## GitHub Commit And Pull Request Rules:

To maintain a clean and organized repository, please follow these guidelines when contributing code:

### Branching Rules
- **Main branch is protected** : No direct commits to main are allowed.
- Create a branch and name it accordinlgy to the task.

### Commit Rules
- Write clear and concise commit messages. Examples: "Added New README file rules".

### Pull Request Rules
1. Create a pull request for all changes.
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
3. Request a review from at least one team member before merging.
4. No self-approval of pull requests without the review of another team member.
5. Include a clear description of the changes in the pull request:
- What problem does it solve?, How was it fixed? or a brief description of the task.


### *That should do it! Now the Jupyter Notebook Environment has been configure. Have fun researching!!*
